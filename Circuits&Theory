1.	Arduino Uno :

The Arduino Uno is an open-source microcontroller board based on the Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller and developed by Arduino.cc. The board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards (shields) and other circuits. The board has 14 Digital pins, 6 Analog pins, and programmable with the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) via a type B USB cable. It can be powered by the USB cable or by an external 9-volt battery, though it accepts voltages between 7 and 20 volts. It is also similar to the Arduino Nano and Leonar. The hardware reference design is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 2.5 license and is available on the Arduino website. Layout and production files for some versions of the hardware are also available.
The word "uno" means "one" in Italian and was chosen to mark the initial release of the Arduino Software. The Uno board is the first in a series of USB-based Arduino boards, and it and version 1.0 of the Arduino IDE were the reference versions of Arduino, now evolved to newer releases. The ATmega328 on the board comes preprogrammed with a bootloader that allows uploading new code to it without the use of an external hardware programmer.

General pin functions
•	LED: There is a built-in LED driven by digital pin 13. When the pin is high value, the LED is on, when the pin is low, it's off.
•	VIN: The input voltage to the Arduino/Genuino board when it's using an external power source (as opposed to 5 volts from the USB connection or 
other regulated power source). You can supply voltage through this pin, or, if supplying voltage via the power jack, access it through this pin.
•	5V: This pin outputs a regulated 5V from the regulator on the board. The board can be supplied with power either from the DC power jack (7 - 20V), the USB connector (5V), or the VIN pin of the board (7-20V). Supplying voltage via the 5V or 3.3V pins bypasses the regulator, and can damage the board.
•	3V3: A 3.3 volt supply generated by the on-board regulator. Maximum current draw is 50 mA.
•	GND: Ground pins.
•	IOREF: This pin on the Arduino/Genuino board provides the voltage reference with which the microcontroller operates. A properly configured shield can read the IOREF pin voltage and select the appropriate power source or enable voltage translators on the outputs to work with the 5V or 3.3V.
•	Reset: Typically used to add a reset button to shields which block the one on the board.

Special pin functions
Each of the 14 digital pins and 6 analog pins on the Uno can be used as an input or output, using pinMode(), digitalWrite(), and digitalRead() functions. They operate at 5 volts. Each pin can provide or receive 20 mA as recommended operating condition and has an internal pull-up resistor (disconnected by default) of 20-50k ohm. A maximum of 40mA is the value that must not be exceeded on any I/O pin to avoid permanent damage to the microcontroller. The Uno has 6 analog inputs, labeled A0 through A5, each of which provide 10 bits of resolution (i.e. 1024 different values). By default they measure from ground to 5 volts, though is it possible to change the upper end of their range using the AREF pin and the analogReference() function.[7]
In addition, some pins have specialized functions:
•	Serial / UART: pins 0 (RX) and 1 (TX). Used to receive (RX) and transmit (TX) TTL serial data. These pins are connected to the corresponding pins of the ATmega8U2 USB-to-TTL serial chip.
•	External interrupts: pins 2 and 3. These pins can be configured to trigger an interrupt on a low value, a rising or falling edge, or a change in value.
•	PWM (pulse-width modulation): 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11. Can provide 8-bit PWM output with the analogWrite() function.
•	SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface): 10 (SS), 11 (MOSI), 12 (MISO), 13 (SCK). These pins support SPI communication using the SPI library.
•	TWI (two-wire interface) / I²C: A4 or SDA pin and A5 or SCL pin. Support TWI communication using the Wire library.
•	AREF (analog reference): Reference voltage for the analog inputs.

Communication
The Arduino/Genuino Uno has a number of facilities for communicating with a computer, another Arduino/Genuino board, or other microcontrollers. The ATmega328 provides UART TTL (5V) serial communication, which is available on digital pins 0 (RX) and 1 (TX). 
An ATmega16U2 on the board channels this serial communication over USB and appears as a virtual com port to software on the computer. The 16U2 firmware uses the standard USB COM drivers, and no external driver is needed. However, on Windows, a .inf file is required.
 The Arduino Software (IDE) includes a serial monitor which allows simple textual data to be sent to and from the board. The RX and TX LEDs on the board will flash when data is being transmitted via the USB-to-serial chip and USB connection to the computer (but not for serial communication on pins 0 and 1). A SoftwareSerial library allows serial communication on any of the Uno's digital pins.

Automatic (software) reset

Rather than requiring a physical press of the reset button before an upload, the Arduino/Genuino Uno board is designed in a way that allows it to be reset by software running on a connected computer. 
One of the hardware flow control lines (DTR) of the ATmega8U2/16U2 is connected to the reset line of the ATmega328 via a 100 nanofarad capacitor. When this line is asserted (taken low), the reset line drops long enough to reset the chip.
This setup has other implications. When the Uno is connected to a computer running Mac OS X or Linux, it resets each time a connection is made to it from software (via USB). For the following half-second or so, the bootloader is running on the Uno.
 While it is programmed to ignore malformed data (i.e. anything besides an upload of new code), it will intercept the first few bytes of data sent to the board after a connection is opened.

2.	LPG Gas Sensor Module – MQ2  :
Sensitive material of MQ-2 gas sensor is SnO2, which with lower conductivity

Notification
1	Following conditions must beprohibited

1.1	Exposed to organic silicon steam
Organic silicon steam cause sensors invalid, sensors must be avoid exposing to silicon bond, fixature, silicon latex, putty or plastic contain silicon environment
1.2	High Corrosivegas
If the sensors exposed to high concentration corrosive gas (such as H2Sz, SOX，Cl2，HCl etc), it will not only result in corrosion of sensors structure, also it cause sincere sensitivity attenuation.
1.3	Alkali, Alkali metals salt, halogenpollution
The sensors performance will be changed badly if sensors be sprayed polluted by alkali metals salt especially brine, or be exposed to halogen such as fluorin.
1.4	Touch water
Sensitivity of the sensors will be reduced when spattered or dipped in water.
1.5	Freezing
Do avoid icing on sensor’surface, otherwise sensor would lose sensitivity.
1.6	Applied voltagehigher
Applied voltage on sensor should not be higher than stipulated value, otherwise it cause down-line or heater damaged, and bring on sensors’ sensitivity characteristic changed badly.
1.7	Voltage on wrong pins
For 6 pins sensor, if apply voltage on 1、3 pins or 4、6 pins, it will make lead broken, and without signal when apply on 2、4 pins

2	Following conditions must beavoided

2.1	WaterCondensation
Indoor conditions, slight water condensation will effect sensors performance lightly. However, if water condensation on sensors surface and keep a certain period,sensor’sensitivity will bedecreased.

2.2	Used in high gas concentration
No matter the sensor is electrified or not, if long time placed in high gas concentration, if will affect sensors characteristic.



2.3	Long-timestorage
The sensors resistance produce reversible drift if it’s stored for long time without electrify, this drift is related with storage conditions. Sensors should be stored in airproof without silicon gel bag with clean air. For the sensors with long time storage but no electrify, they need long aging time for stbility before using.

2.4	Long-time exposed to adverseenvironment
No matter the sensors electrified or not, if exposed to adverse environment for long time, such as high humidity, high temperature, or high pollution etc, it will effect the sensors performance badly.

2.5	Vibration
Continual vibration will result in sensors down-lead response then repture. In transportation or assembling line, pneumatic screwdriver/ultrasonic welding machine can lead this vibration.


2.6	Concussion
If sensors meet strong concussion, it may lead its lead wire disconnected.

2.7	Usage
For sensor, handmade welding is optimal way. If use wave crest welding should meet the following conditions:

2.7.1	Soldering flux: Rosin soldering flux contains leastchlorine
2.7.2	Speed: 1-2 Meter/Minute
2.7.3	Warm-uptemperature：100±20℃
2.7.4	Weldingtemperature：250±10℃
2.7.5	1 time pass wave crest weldingmachine


If disobey the above using terms, sensors sensitivity will be reduced.



3.	Buzzer :

A buzzer or beeper is an audio signalling device, which may be mechanical,electromechanical, or piezoelectric.Buzzer is an integrated structure of electronic transducers, DC power supply, widely used in computers, printers, copiers, alarms, electronic toys, automotive electronic equipment, telephones, timers and other electronic products for sound devices.Typical uses of buzzers and beepers include alarm devices, timers and confirmation of user input such as a mouse click or keystroke.
 

It is a piezoelectric buzzer which has a piezoelectric diaphragm of three terminals which are related to the self drive circuits. Using suitable resonant circuits, a large output sound can be obtained. Such buzzers are used in gas alarms, burglar alarms, etc. In this detector the buzzer gives the output sound when the LPG gas is detected by the sensor. So the buzzer serves as the audio output of the detector. 
While technological advancements have caused buzzers to be impractical and undesirable, there are still instances in which buzzers and similar circuits may be used. Present day applications include:
•	Novelty uses
•	Judging panels
•	Educational purposes
•	Annunciator panels
•	Electronic metronomes
•	Game show lock-out device
•	Microwave ovens and other household appliances
•	Sporting events such as basketball games
•	Electrical alarms
•	Joy buzzer (mechanical buzzer used for pranks)

Applications of the Gas Detector Module:


1) This project can be used in home and hotel utility (kitchen) area for safety purpose.
2) Useful in domestic LPG water heater.

5) This system is very useful in hotels, home, car, LPG agencies. This system has advance safety standard and most important this helps prevent accident occurred because of fire.
























WORKING:


The working of any advanced system is mainly dependent on the microcontroller which controls the entire functioning of the device. In this case the Arduino Uno microcontroller acts like a conditional switch. It performs two set of action depending upon the condition present. It triggers the buzzer and the LED glows when the leakage of the gas is detected by the sensor. The other action is that LED does not glow when the leakage of the gas is not detected by the sensor. This device to make the stakeholders aware about the leakage of gas taking place at their house in their absence so that necessary actions can be implemented immediately to prevent an accident. MQ2 (LPG Gas) sensor is used to detect LPG leakage this sensor has quick response time it responding very short period of time. LED works when MQ2 crosses threshold level. And also a Buzzer is turned on to give Alert indication. We have provided a potentiometer which is used to vary the threshold level of comparator which decides the threshold level of leakage condition.
